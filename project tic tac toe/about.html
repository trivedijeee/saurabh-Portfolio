    <h1>Project : Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The Tic Tac Toe game implemented here is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'). The game interface includes a modal for players to enter their names before starting, adding a personalized touch to the gameplay experience.</p>
    <h2>Features:</h2>
    <h3>Game Mechanics:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Players alternate turns to click on empty cells to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').</li>
      <li>The game checks for a win after each move by comparing the current board state against predefined winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals).</li>
      <li>If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Interface:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Player Names:</strong> Upon loading the page, a modal prompts players to enter their names before starting the game. This feature enhances user interaction by personalizing the game experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Board:</strong> The game board is responsive, adjusting its layout based on the screen size. It maintains a clean and modern aesthetic with a contrasting color scheme for readability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Status Messages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The status area above the board dynamically updates to reflect whose turn it is or to announce the winner/draw.</li>
        <li>Modified to display "Player One Name wins!" instead of generic "Player X wins!" for a more personalized experience based on entered player names.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reset and Start:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Players can reset the game at any time, clearing the board and resetting all game variables.</li>
        <li>Upon entering player names and starting the game, the modal closes, and the game status updates to indicate the starting player's turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Design Considerations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Styling:</strong> The game interface utilizes modern CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid layouts for responsiveness and aesthetics.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> The modal for entering player names features a centered layout with input fields and a button to start the game, ensuring ease of use and clear instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Implementation:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Defines the structure of the game interface, including the modal for player names and the game board.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Provides styling to create a visually appealing and responsive layout, enhancing user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Implements game logic such as handling player moves, checking for wins/draws, updating game status, and managing player input through the modal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Player:</strong> Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.</li>
        <li><strong>Score Tracking:</strong> Add functionality to track and display scores across multiple games.</li>
        <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Enhance user experience with animations for moves and game transitions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>
        This project showcases a well-designed and functional implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with added features for player personalization through name input. It serves as a foundation for further enhancements and can be expanded with additional features to enrich the gameplay experience.</p>
